# Things to think about
- would be nice to be automatically generate the rest endpoints from given services / interfaces
- alternative mappings for custom endpoints (like automapper)
- auth in rest call
- type conversions (serialization - things like Expando / Newtonsoft may help)



# Notes

new shim:
